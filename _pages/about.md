Namaste!<br>
I currently work as a research assistant at [HiAccel lab](https://www.sfu.ca/~zhenman/group), while enrolled as a MASc student studying [Computer Engineering at Simon Fraser University (SFU)](https://www.sfu.ca/engineering/research/computer-engineering.html) and advised by [Dr. Zhenman Fang](https://www.sfu.ca/~zhenman/index.html).

My current research interests include characterization of __accelerator-rich architectures__ and __systems for ML__. Most of my work tightly involves relevant EDA. I think that closing the gap between software-programmers and hardware-designers is as tremendously significant as challenging.<br>
I am also interested in the general study of __cognition, sentience__ and behaviour of the __mind__, and always open to discuss neuroscience-inspired hardware architecture design.

Before joining HiAccel, I worked at [Imagination Technologies](https://www.imaginationtech.com/) as a Design Engineer for uncore IPs of RISC-V based automotive CPUs, and at [Micron Technology](https://in.micron.com/) as a SoC Verification Engineer for UFS storage controllers (ASICs). During my late undergraduate years, I worked as a guest researcher with the [Chair for Processor Design, CFAED](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/pd-about), while working on accelerator designs for reinforcement learning. 
<!-- This work has been published in IEEE TCAD 2020 and an extension for it presented at GLSVLSI '21.<br> -->
Before I dived into computer architecture, I tinkered with electronics and used my degree in Electronics & Instrumentation to make low-budget laboratory equipment - a cheap potentiostat for voltammetry and a spectrophotometer for colorimetry over the visible region. These are Arduino-based designs, firmware for both of these are available as free downloads on [my Github](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}). This work was possible because of my engagement with the [MMNE Lab](https://www.mmne.in/).

I received my B.E. in Electronics Engineering in 2020 from [BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/).
