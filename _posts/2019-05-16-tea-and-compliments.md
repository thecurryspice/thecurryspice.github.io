I love tea. Freshly poured out, steaming, I compare its vapours to the fragrance of incense sticks. Both are equally adept at refreshing a dull room, and my mood.  
However much of an elixir it looks like, tea is always meant to be sipped.

I take in compliments like I take in tea.  
I sip on tea.  
I know that I'll burn my tongue if I take it in all at once.  
It will make my tongue immune to any other thing I taste, be it tea or coffee. My taste-buds will stop functioning and for some time, I wouldn't respond to different flavours that I taste.  
Thanks to tea, I don't outright reject any beverage that is offered to me, but I sip it slowly. People seem to like it that way.
