For a savagicious/sapiential/omniscient person, acing Humanities courses might come off as leisurely.<br>
For me, however, it seems more demanding than a clingy girlfriend.<br>

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the courses I take, and study them too, but I believe it is my lack of a certain level of prudence that thresholds the secret to making Humanities courses easy.<br>
I feel that after about a month of failing to be good in these courses, I have cracked the secret to success.<br>

<u><b><i>Wordism</i></b> (<i>noun</i>: |wurdi-s(u)m| )</u>: *Wordism* is the ismy ism that advocates the hypothesis of theories by the suffixation of **ism** to a common noun<br>
(for example, Wordism).

Hands down, I know there's no such thing as Wordism. But it's a theory, right? Theories are meant to be ...well, theorised.<br>
Wrong!<br>
Three Golden Rules:
1. Theories have to be accepted by a large group in order to have them recognised.
2. Point 1 is very important.
3. The resistance faced when thinking against an already established theory can erode your soul away.

Where do you think feminism stood in the 19th century?<br>
Fun fact, it didn't.<br>
Every time it tried to take a stand, it was beaten down by authoritative masculine hands.<br>
And now there are theories in theories of the doctrine called Feminism.<br>

Have an in-depth knowledge about certain doctrines to exploit Wordism, throw in a punch of your GRE-shaming vocabulary, write your heart out and voila!<br>

Please tell me you didn't fall for all this.<br>
Because, for a savagicious/sapiential/omniscient person, acing Humanities courses might come off as leisurely.<br>
For me, however, it seems more demanding than a clingy girlfriend.<br>
