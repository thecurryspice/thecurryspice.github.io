<br>
I have a propensity for appreciating beautiful pieces of porcelain.<br>
Sometimes, I take a few moments off of my routine and relax, just to criticize porcelain.<br>
I have a personal inclination towards the meaningfully designed ones; the plain, the simple, with an occasional swirl on the exterior, or a small but complex pattern on one side; the monochrome, with a colour gradient so random that it feels like it was intentionally planned.<br>
But I find everything interesting, be it the average pieces that people usually ignore, or the pieces that are meaningfully designed, or the beautiful show-pieces that serve no practical purpose, everything goes well with a nice bouquet, which, depending on the permutations of colour and number of petals, can both mask the porcelain's plain-ness and (or) accentuate its intricacies.

My experience with life has taught me that some people are too valuable for my paltry hands.<br>
Like beautiful porcelain pots, intricately, meaningfully designed for different uses.<br>
It's times when I catch myself mindlessly eyeing these masterpieces that I realise that it's always better to appreciate such valuable stuff from a distance for a lifetime, rather than being elated by its possession for a relatively short time.<br>
I'd rather keep my trembling, inept hands away from precious porcelain.<br>
But I'll be sure to put a bouquet there.<br>
<br>

Because Bouquets in Porcelain sure look beautiful.<br>
