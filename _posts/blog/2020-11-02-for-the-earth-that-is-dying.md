Our Earth is dying. I don't need to explain or prove this. All knowledgable folks on this planet already know how we have set it up for doom, unless we act on averting it now. If 7 billion humans can 'mistakenly' destroy an entire planet, they can also revive it back into full spring.

In all honesty, I have a terribly soft spot for the Earth's bio-diversity. Be it the evolution of funky birds and their quirky dances to attract a potential prom-date or be it the wrestling of two beetles for territory - a small branch on a shrub. As a kid, I used to watch [Animal Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Planet), a brilliant television channel that streamed documentaries about animals. Scenes from these documentaries kicked my heart in all directions, mocking how minuscule the scale of my experiences was. I have no shame in admitting that watching such documentaries, coupled with amazing cinematography, pushes me into an intense swirl of emotions, which seldom erupts out as a teardrop.<br>
As a **gift** from my side, here's a 2-minute video on walruses. Walruses dive in the oceans to hunt for prey and then come up to the icy shore to rest. However, since the ice-sheet is rapidly narrowing and thinning, the walruses have to seek refuge on rocky cliffs. What follows, can not be described in words alone.

This is just a couple of minutes of the second episode of the Our Planet series.

To realise that somehow, indirectly, I am part of the reason why walruses in Russia go through this, is incredibly heart-wrenching.<br>
My interest to work on better compute-architectures is not a mere application of my passion for all things electronics and programming. It is significantly fuelled by a deep-rooted interest to avert the climate crisis.

**Why should I optimise compute clusters though?** Is it that significant?<br>
Compute clusters, data farms, etc, use insane amounts of energy. For example, [this Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertbryce/2020/10/21/googles-dominance-is-fueled-by-zambia-size-amounts-of-electricity/?sh=25dc54d268c9) describes how Google alone uses about **12.4 terawatt hours** of electricity in 2019. To put this in perspective, this much energy is more than enough to power entire Sri Lanka for a year!<br>
Optimising an architecture by even 1% is a great contribution towards controlling irreversible damage.

But you might claim that making better engines for vehicles, moving to renewable sources of energy, etc are better ideas. What I feel is that some physical conditions constrain the efficiencies we can achieve. For example, the concept of Carnot cycle, on which the air-conditioner/refrigerator work, is only about 70% efficient in the present day. If your refrigerator is about 8-10 years old, the efficiency will be about 40-45%.<br>
Because humans have an _operating temperature range_ (outside which they simply die, pfff pathetic), all thermodynamics related to energy-conversion needs to happen around this temperature. Now, this temperature range is not a suitable condition for achieving maximum efficiency. Safe to say, it will be impractical to achieve extremely efficient devices in the near future.<br>

We are going to need a lot of compute in the years to come. Everything in the world is shifting to a digital landscape - from research simulations to government documentations. I feel that a shortage of silicon is underway. I think that markets related to semiconductor materials will become an immense factor in economy.<br>
To humanity, as it stands right now, finding a planet with rich reserves of pure silicon is much more valuable than finding a planet of diamonds!<br>
This explosion of semiconductor requirement is in some ways, similar to the trends in the transport industry. Cars and bikes are akin to personal electronic devices; and cargo ships and airlines are compute clusters managed by large corporations. Everyone will be using these technologies at some point. It took several decades before regulations on engine-emissions were enforced. Consequently, new engines were designed, leading to cleaner alternatives.<br>
However this time, we're significantly aware of our impact on the environment. Emission standards and power regulations already set in place for compute farms or coin-mining facilities are doing a good job. But a better job can be done. Before we actually face a crisis of smoke, we can start building a better engine for the future.

That's why I want to optimise compute, even though we have it fast enough for now.<br>
That's also why I turn off that extra light that's still on.<br>
Not because it will, later on, at some point in time, matter in the grand perspective. No.<br>
I turn it off because it matters, right now, in this moment.<br>
I turn it off for me; for the Earth that is dying.
