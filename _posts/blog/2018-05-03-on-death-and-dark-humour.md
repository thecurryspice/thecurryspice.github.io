title: On Death and Dark Humour

There's this sense of urgency that dawns over me whenever I think about Death.<br>
An urgency that warms my chest everytime, a micro heart-attack, almost similar to when I don't feel my phone in my pocket.

Constant reminders of Death exhort me, like a crowd cheering an Olympic runner who tripped miserably, to be productive by motivating me to extract as much as of my time as I possibly can.<br>
As dark as it may sound, Death, to me, is the strongest incentive to do something.<br>
The strongest incentive to do something is the regret of not doing it!<br>
And this is one thing I'm seriously afraid of, what if I don't have enough time to try out all the interesting things in this world.<br>
As a matter of fact, there actually isn't enough time to try out all the interesting things, and people around me are so lively that I usually forget about this urgency, this ultimate statistic, that 10 out of 10 people die. And birthdays come handy, as constant reminders of my death, a constant reminder of my limited time.

It is here that dark humour comes into play.<br>
Having a ghoulish, morbid sense of humour is, in my understanding, a mirthful, tragicomic goldmine. Be it self-depreciation or ugly dysphemisms, they act as frequent light-hearted reminders of the shortage of time.<br>
Cracking such dark jokes elicit some humour, but also leave a taint on the mind, making a lasting impression of the insight or epiphany.<br>
Although this usually leads me into undesirable situations with friends, where I become a spoilsport for cracking lame-ass dark jokes in a rather enthusiastic environment, I still believe in the idea of positive macabre (weird oxymoron, right?) and I feel it has guided me correctly and helped me made a lot of important decisions which otherwise would have been onerous dilemmas.
