My stay at [Adani Power Maharashtra Limited, Tirora](http://www.adanipower.com/businesses/operational-power-plants/tiroda), has been amazing.<br>
As mentioned in one of my previous posts, the scale is humbling.<br>

I have (more or less) completed my project here, and there's some obvious delay in implementation because of the insane number of field-testing trials that will be conducted. This leaves me rather free since the past couple of days. I have ample time to relax/sleep/chillout in my comfy room, or go out on random walks to explore the villages around, or lie down on the cool morning grass and think about nothing.<br>
Have you ever caught yourself thinking about nothing?<br>
It's not nothing actually, but extremely random sequences of thoughts/visual-imagery/air-castles leading to a temporary, minuscule blank, short enough to give you a break, and long enough to grab your attention.

The mornings here are serene, apart from the faint low-frequency rumble of the turbines and generators of the plant, which I've now become immune to.<br>

This park has several metal benches, all painted to give an illusion of a wooden texture. I usually lay down on one of these benches in the mornings. The wooden texture on the solid metal is, ofcourse, synonymous with maintaining greenery in a coal-based thermal power plant.<br>

Every bench is positioned directly below a tree. And it's quite awkward to accept that it's not the bench positioned directly below the tree, no.<br>
It's the bench *as well as* the tree positioned very specifically.<br>
That's the problem with artificially created nature - once you realise it, the fake elements are painfully obvious.<br>
I still like to lie down on these benches, only to look up straight into the dense leaf-clusters and branches, thinking of binary tree structures, or track the trail of the omnipresent ants from the bark to as far up as my eye resolution would allow me, or look blankly, and catch myself thinking of nothing.

The bench, although not real wood, harbours mosquitoes and beetles, and sometimes bird poop, which are unfortunately very real.<br>
Every morning, I find new dead leaves. Yellow and brown and curled, perfectly ready to make the satisfying crunch if I happen to step on them.<br>
Sometimes, my gullible brain melts at little things it observes. Like how the grass below the trees is always green, because of the shade, but more so because of the yellow and brown and curled leaves lying on the ground saving the underlying grass from losing its moisture, ultimately saving up more water for the tree's roots.<br>
Sometimes, the efficiency of nature makes me feel pathetic for myself, be it my fucked sleep routine, or my bipolar eating habits, or my attention span equivalent to the time it takes a dog to spot a squirrel running across an open area.

There's so much to learn, to improve, and insight can be drawn as easily as lying down under a tree on a metal bench, thinking about nothing :)
