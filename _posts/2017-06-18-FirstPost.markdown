I've always wanted to start a blog. About things I learn and explore. About things that I find interesting. About projects that I can boast of and about projects that disappoint me beyond belief.<br>
Today marks the day when I start sharing my experiences and learnings as an undergraduate in Electronics.


By the way,<br>
Congratulations!<br>
On finding an unlisted post.<br>
How much time have you wasted here already?
