Namaste!<br>
I am currently a MASc student studying [Computer Engineering at Simon Fraser University (SFU)](https://www.sfu.ca/engineering/research/computer-engineering.html), advised by [Dr. Zhenman Fang](https://www.sfu.ca/~zhenman/index.html).<br>
I am also a research assistant at [HiAccel lab](https://www.sfu.ca/~zhenman/group). My current research interests include characterization of __accelerator-rich architectures and systems for ML__. Most of my work tightly involves relevant EDA. I think that closing the gap between software-programmers and hardware-designers is as trememdously significant as challenging.<br>
I am also interested in the general study of __cognition, sentience__ and behaviour of the __mind__, and always open to discuss neuroscience-inspired hardware architecture design.

Before joining HiAccel, I worked at [Imagination Technologies](https://www.imaginationtech.com/) as a CPU Design Engineer, and at [Micron Technology](https://in.micron.com/) as a SoC Verification Engineer.<br>
During my late undergraduate years, I worked as a guest researcher with the [Chair for Processor Design, CFAED](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/pd-about), while working on accelerator designs for reinforcement learning. This work has been published in IEEE TCAD 2020 and an extension for it presented at GLSVLSI '21.<br>
Before I dived into computer architecture, I loved to tinker with electronics and used my degree in Electronics & Instrumentation to make low-budget laboratory equipment. My design for potentiostat is published in ECS Journal of Solid State Science and Techonology, 2020. I also designed a spectrophotometer for colorimetry over the visible region. These are Arduino-based designs, firmware for both of these are available as free downloads on [my Github](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}). This work was possible because of my engagement with the [MMNE Lab](https://www.mmne.in/).<br>
I received my B.E. in Electronics Engineering from [BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/).

In my natural habitat, I can occasionally be observed writing in silence.<br>

Here's my (hopefully updated) [resume(PDF)](assets/resumeARB.pdf).

    I can be contacted through any of these links:<b>  </b>

I respond fastest on LinkedIn.
