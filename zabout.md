Akhil currently works as an ASIC Design Engineer at [Micron Technology](https://in.micron.com/).  
He holds a B.E. in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from [BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/) and has strong inclinations towards Computer Architecture and Systems for ML.<br>
He has also worked as a guest researcher with the [Chair for Processor Design, CFAED](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/pd-about) while working on accelerator designs for reinforcement learning.<br>

In his spare time, Akhil can be found tinkering with electronics. The stuff he builds doesn't usually compensate for the stuff he tears down.<br>
He can occasionally be found writing short poems. It's possible that he's currently sipping Chai.

<!-- Akhil is not a web-developer, and is too dumb to talk anything about web-development.<br>
Although, if you do find him blabbering about web-development, remind him that this blog has been made using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. -->
