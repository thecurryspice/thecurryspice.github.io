Akhil currently works as an ASIC Design Engineer at [Micron Technology](https://in.micron.com/).  
He holds a B.E. in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from [BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/) and has strong inclinations towards Computer Architecture and Systems for ML.<br>
He has also worked as a guest researcher with the [Chair for Processor Design, CFAED](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/pd-about) while working on accelerator designs for reinforcement learning.<br>

In his spare time, Akhil can be found tinkering with electronics. The stuff he builds doesn't usually compensate for the stuff he tears down.<br>
A jack of some trades by decision and a sarcastic retard by choice, he likes writing short poems whenever he breaks out of reverie after looking out of a train's window.<br>
Akhil loves all forms of chai, with a partial preference to [Masala chai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masala_chai). He oftens becomes the odd one out in a group because of prioritising Chai over Coffee. He keeps shut about the topic mostly, but when feeling extremely left out, he tries to impart lessons on how wonderful Chai is.<br>

Akhil is not a web-developer, and is too dumb to talk anything about web-development.<br>
Although, if you do find him blabbering about web-development, remind him that this blog has been made using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>.
