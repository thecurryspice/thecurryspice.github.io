Namaste!<br>
I am currently a MASc student studying [Computer Engineering at Simon Fraser University (SFU)](https://www.sfu.ca/engineering/research/computer-engineering.html), advised by [Dr. Zhenman Fang](https://www.sfu.ca/~zhenman/index.html).<br>
I am also a research assistant at [HiAccel lab](https://www.sfu.ca/~zhenman/group). My current research interests include characterization of __accelerator-rich architectures, systems for ML, and neuromorphic architectures__. I think that closing the gap between software programmers and hardware design is as trememdously significant as challenging.<br>
I am also interested in the general study of __cognition, sentience__ and behaviour of the __mind__, and always open to discuss bio-inspired hardware architecture design.

Before joining HiAccel, I worked at [Imagination Technologies](https://www.imaginationtech.com/) as a CPU Design Engineer, and at [Micron Technology](https://in.micron.com/) as a SoC Verification Engineer.<br>
Before CoViD reconfigured my priorities, I worked as a guest researcher with the [Chair for Processor Design, CFAED](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/pd-about), while working on accelerator designs for reinforcement learning.<br>
I received my B.E. in Electrical Engineering from [BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/).

In my natural habitat, I can occasionally be observed writing in silence.<br>
It's possible I'm currenty sipping Chai <sub>(slurp)</sub>
