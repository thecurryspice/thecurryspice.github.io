* Not each and every case of depression is to be traced back to a feeling of meaninglessness, nor does suicide.
* If it is avoidable, the meaningful thing to do is to remove its cause, for unnecessary suffering is masochistic rather than heroic.
* Consider a movie: it consists of thousands upon thousands of individual pictures, and each of them makes sense and carries a meaning, yet the meaning of the whole film cannot be seen before its last sequence is shown. However, we cannot understand the whole film without having first understood each of its components, each of the individual pictures. Isn't it the same with life? Doesn't the final meaning of life, too, reveal itself, if at all, only at its end, on the verge of death? And doesn't this final meaning, too, depend on whether or not the potential meaning of each single situation has been actualized to the best of the respective individual's knowledge and belief?
* Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now.
* In the past, nothing is irretrievably lost, but rather, on the contrary, everything is irrevocably stored and treasured.
