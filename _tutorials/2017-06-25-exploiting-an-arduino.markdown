When I made the [ATmega Register Reference](https://arbaranwal.github.io/tutorial/2017/06/23/atmega328-register-reference.html), I came to know about a lot of internals of the ATmega328(P). This series is a humble attempt to share that information with everyone.

The Arduino boards are marvellous shortcuts to the introduction to the diverse field of robotics. This series of articles will demonstrate the exploitation of some uncommon things of the ATmega328 chip, which might be (or might not be) directly or indirectly beneficial. I can't guarantee that the following articles will help someone make some uber-cool gadget, but these articles will definitely make anyone respect the level of abstraction and modularity that the world of electronics have achieved.

Begin with the series [here](https://arbaranwal.github.io/tutorial/2017/06/30/advanced-io.html)
