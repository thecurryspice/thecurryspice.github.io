If I call you here everyday, you’ll work for 6 hours everyday, but if I leave you to your rooms, you will work for 12 hours.”<br> And this was actually great, I could comfortably stay in my room with the air-conditioner blasting 22 degrees while the temperature outside was as high as 46 degrees.<br> The only restriction I had was that I should be carrying my helmet and wearing safety shoes while on work.<br> Fair Enough.<br></p> <hr> <p><br></p> <h2 id="the-plant">The Plant</h2> <p>The campus is insanely huge.<br> The transformers, the turbines, the generators, the pumps, the electrical wiring, everything is insanely huge. The scale is humbling.<br> For reference, regular pumps here have a flow rate of 22.22 cubic metres per second!<br> To a guy like me, who interfaces delicate electronics which smoke at 10mA and can get destroyed due to static electricity, seeing a transformer almost double in size of his hostel room was numbing.<br> I remember being speechless while on my first field trip inside the power plant.<br> Everything I looked at screamed at me the beauty of Electronics, the scalability, the delicacy, the intricacy. If only someone could play Sigur Ros in the background with a recording of me looking at everything in slow motion, I would have looked like a man who had just discovered the missionary position.</p> <p>In spite of all this, I grew immune to the 1600-acre-engineering-beauty exponentially as each day passed.<br></p> <hr> <p><br></p> <h2 id="the-project">The Project</h2> <p>Due to some corporate restrictions, I cannot fully disclose my project, but it is based on developing a semi-intelligent HMI for automating several pumps.<br> The project is based on Android, and looking at the extremely ordered intricacies of Android Studio made me quite afraid of whether I’ll be able to complete the project.<br> I must state here that I have had absolutely no idea of Android programming before this, and that the last time I had written Java code was in class 10th for some basic calculator.<br> Quite mortified by the scale of the project, I proposed a timeline that I hoped I would be able to follow without disappointing anyone.<br> But what ended up happening was that I finished on 28th May what I had scheduled for 15th June.<br> And so, I realised I had 17 days to idle around before anyone could begin to question me on what I was doing. Today is the 2nd day, 15 more to go!<br></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/blog/unsorted/lakeBirds-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/blog/unsorted/lakeBirds-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/blog/unsorted/lakeBirds-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/blog/unsorted/lakeBirds.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Flock Along Lake" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> This is what I found while exploring this place for 2 days. This flock turns up at this spot every evening and leaves by dusk. They make insanely cacophonous quacks so I don't try to approach them any further. </div> <p>Well, I cannot idle around for 15 days, and I’ve decided to just dive head-on into this project, because I’m beginning to get comfortable with Android Studio’s environment. It’s not just the Java that troubles me, but Android’s lingo, like understanding Gradle files and why they need to be perfectly configured, or manifest files, or Contexts and common macros, or an idle emulator consuming 1.5 GBs of RAM, that take some time getting used to.<br></p> <hr> <p><br></p> <h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2> <p>Although I appreciate the ordered life of employees that work here, I detest it too.<br> I can never expect myself to look at 3 huge screens to monitor for faults. A corporation that doesn’t delve into new flows, new methodologies, new technology and research will not be able to deliver redeeming tasks. I understand that sitting in a cosy chair comfortably while looking at screens and sipping tea might define perfect jobs for some people, but not me.<br> I don’t think I can work in a corporation which has no research interests.<br> I’d honestly prefer repairing vintage electronic devices at a local store over such kind of work.<br></p> <p>But aren’t circumstances brutally coercive?</p> <hr> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/2025-already/">2025 already, is it?</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/micron-imagination-hiaccel/">Restarting in 2024</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2021/on-finding-your-zima-blue/">On Finding Your Zima Blue</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2021/on-potential-and-capacity/">On Potential and Capacity</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2020/for-the-earth-that-is-dying/">For The Earth That Is Dying</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Akhil Raj Baranwal.
